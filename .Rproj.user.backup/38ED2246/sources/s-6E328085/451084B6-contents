Description: Chief among instaExtract's functionality is providing the 
  tools for the user to pull relevant data from Instagram. This is
  accomplished by pulling information from JSON links constructed based 
  on the user's query. These queries may be based on a user, a location, 
  a particular post, or a hashtag. The package then returns a dataframe
  with the information relating to either the selected item or a number
  of items. These returned values depend on what item is being created, 
  but contain such things as the username, date, number of likes, relevant 
  hashtags, and a permanent link.  These fields form a foundation for 
  analysts to discover trends and patterns relating to their field of 
  study. For example, an intel officer might find that an inoccous hashtag 
  is highly correlated with known members of an orginzation. 
  While the goal is for this package to be updated and accumulate useful
  functions as they are developed in the real world, the package starts
  only as a tool to pull information. Therefor, the end-user does not 
  require much to any skill.  Simply knowing what they are looking for
  is all that is required.  In creating a shiny app, creating an interface
  that illustrates what capacity for searching the package will do will 
  further reduce the complexity of the package.
