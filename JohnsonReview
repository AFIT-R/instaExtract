Accuracy

The results appear to be accurate. I launched the ShinyApp and tested out my Instagram username. It pulled it up correctly with the 
accurate data about my account listed.
The hashtag info I searched getCurrentTopMediaByTag appears to be running correctly from what I can tell from the instagram results listed.

Yes, it can be seen straightforwardly how the results are being obtained. The functions are well-commented and clear. I was able to see 
what his lines of code are doing to pull the desired information from Instagram. E.G I can see that the pkg jsonlite is used extensively to
pull certain tidbits from Instagram.

Compilation

Yes, the analytic loaded and performed suitably. No issues upon start-up.
The only issue I encountered (posted under ISSUES) is that I receieved an error when running:
getMediaByUsername("officialrickastley", 50)  which is the line of code suggested at the bottom of the function description
Other than that, all functions I tested ran as intended and produced the desirable results.

Ease of Use

The documentation and descriptions are informative and clear. I was able to easily see the purpose and how-to behind the numerous list of 
functions inside his package. The output from some of the functions in the R console was pretty chaotic and messy. e.g. when I ran:
getCurrentTopMediaByTag("cool"), the output was pretty hard to digest and understand. Other than that though, the output was clear and 
informative,  especially when using the launched Shiny app.

Overall it's clear that a lot of intensive and focused work went into this package. Its capabilities are numerous and it works as designed to
provide the user/analyst with multiple ways of assessing and 'visualizing' instagram data. It's a multi-faceted tool that is very powerful 
and unique in the assets it provides to those wishing to gain Instagram insights (marketers, intelligence community, social media experts, 
etc!). I give this project a 47/50, with the only issue needing fixing being the issue I brought up above with the getMediaByUsername fncn.
